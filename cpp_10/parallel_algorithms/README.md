(C) Andy Thomason 2016 for Ubisoft C++ multithreading masterclass.

Example implementations of C++17 parallel algorithms

Note that parellel algorithms at due to come with c++17 soon.

Build with cmake.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make (or run solution of VC++)

## for_each

This example shows how to iterate over a collection in parallel

## sort

This example gives a parallel alternative to std::sort
